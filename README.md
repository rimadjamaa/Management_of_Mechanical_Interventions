## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in designing and implementing databases using both relational and NoSQL approaches. It covers various aspects such as schema modeling, data manipulation, and querying techniques.

## Project Structure
- `SQL3`: Contains scripts and files related to the SQL3-Oracle part of the project.
- `NoSQL`: Includes documents and scripts for the NoSQL (MongoDB) part of the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the SQL3 environment:
   - Create tablespaces (`SQL3_TBS` and `SQL3_TempTBS`).
   - Create a user `SQL3` and assign the tablespaces.
   - Grant necessary privileges to the user.
3. Install MongoDB and set up the NoSQL environment.

## Usage
- Detailed instructions for running SQL3 and NoSQL scripts.
- Guidelines for executing queries and manipulating data.
